If a wide figure (one that is wider than the text) is included in a regular figure environment, it will extend into the right margin.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{box.pdf}
  \caption{A wide figure in a regular figure environment}
\end{figure}

By using the \texttt{\textbackslash makebox} command, a wide figure can be made to extend into both margins.\\

\noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{
\includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{box.pdf}}
\captionof{figure}{A wide figure included in a \texttt{\textbackslash makebox}}
